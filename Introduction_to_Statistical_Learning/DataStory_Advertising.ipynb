        "For a given amount of TV and newspaper advertising, spending additional \\$1,000 on radio advertising is associated with approximately 189 units of additional sales. Comparing these coefficient estimates to those computed individually, we notice that the multiple regression coefficient estimates for *TV* and *Radio* are pretty similar to the simple linear regression coefficient estimates. However, while *Newspaper* regression coefficient estimate in simple linear model was significantly non-zero, the coefficient estimate for *Newspaper* in multiple regression model is close to zero, and the corresponding $p$-value is no longer significant, with a value around $0.86$. This illustrates that the simple and multiple regression coefficients can be quite different. This difference stems from the fact that in the simple regression case, the slope term represents the average increase in product sales associated with a unit increase in newspaper advertising, ignoring other predictors such as *TV* and *Radio*. By contrast, in the multiple regression setting, the coefficent for *Newspaper* represents the average increase in product sales associated with increasing newspaper spending by one unit while holding *TV* and *Radio* fixed.\n",
