        "Consider a given estimate $\\hat{f}$ and a set of predictors $X$, which yields the prediction $\\hat{Y} = \\hat{f}(X)$. Assume for a moment that both $\\hat{f}$ and $X$ are fixed, so that only variability comes from $\\epsilon$. Then, it is easy to show that\n",

        "\n",
        "2. After a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the training data to *fit* or *train* the model. In case of the linear model $(4)$, we need to estimate the parameters $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_p$. That is, we want to find values of these parameters such that\n",

        "\n",
        "**Non-Parametric Methods** do not make explicit assumptions about the functional form of $f$. Instead they seek an estimate of $f$ that gets as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly. An example is a *thin-plate spline*. In order ro fit a thin-plate spline, the data analyst must select a level of smoothness."
