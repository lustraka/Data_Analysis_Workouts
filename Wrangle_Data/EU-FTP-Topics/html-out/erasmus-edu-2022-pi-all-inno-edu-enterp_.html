addressing societal challenges or relating to changes in attitudes and values, strategies and policies, organisational structures and processes, delivery systems and services;</li><li>Developing solutions for challenging issues, product and process innovation (through the collaboration of students, professors and practitioners).</li> </ul><p><strong>Developing a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets, competences and skills</strong></p><ul level="0"><li>Developing new teaching methods and learning tools that incorporate transversal skills learning and application throughout higher education and VET programmes developed in cooperation with enterprises and aimed at strengthening employability, creativity and new professional pathways;</li><li>Introducing wherever appropriate a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in a given discipline, curriculum, course, etc. to provide students, researchers, staff and educators with the competences, skills and motivation to develop a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-set and to be able to confront various challenges in their educational, professional and private lives;</li><li>Opening up new learning opportunities through the practical experiences and application of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial competences and skills which can involve and/or lead to the launch of new services, products and prototypes, and the creation of start-ups and spin-offs;</li><li>Introducing more "student-centred approaches" with students tailor-making their own educational pathways.</li> </ul><p><strong>Stimulating the flow and exchange of knowledge between higher education, VET, enterprises and research</strong></p><ul level="0"><li>Building inclusive and connected HE, VET systems and enterprises through mutual trust, cross-border recognition and certification, flexible pathways between VET and HE and fostering the mobility for learners and workers;</li><li>Apprenticeships and study field related activities in enterprises, which are fully embedded in the curriculum, recognised and credited; set-ups to trial and test innovative measures; exchanges of students, researchers, teaching staff and enterprise staff for a limited period; providing incentives for involvement of enterprise staff into teaching and research; analysis of research data.</li> </ul><p><strong>Identifying resilience-related, market needs and emerging professions</strong></p><ul level="0"><li>Identifying market needs and emerging professions (demand side), enhancing the responsiveness of systems at all levels to labour market needs (supply side); adapting HE and VET provision to skills needs by designing and delivering transnational sector-wide curricula integrating work-based learning;</li><li>Identifying those skills that are needed in the public domain to solve societal challenges (e.g. climate change, health) and encourage resilience at societal and community level, including via the cooperation of HEIs and VET providers with national, regional and local authorities as well as the private sector to contribute to designing and implementing Smart Specialisation Strategies in regions;</li><li>Providing support to overcome the skills mismatch both for resilience and market needs.</li> </ul><p>Alliances for Innovation are required to apply EU wide instruments and tools, such as the EQF, ESCO, Europass, EQAVET and ESG, whenever relevant.</p><p>To try and test new curricula or new training and learning methods, Alliances for Innovation may organise learning mobility activities of students, teachers, researchers and staff in so far as they support/complement the main activities of the partnerships and bring added value in the implementation of the project's objectives.</p><p><strong>EXPECTED IMPACT</strong></p><p>Alliances for Innovation will be anchored in strategic and sustainable cooperation among vocational education and training, higher education and enterprises working together to boost the innovation capacity of Europe. They will considerably strengthen the synergies between both educational fields in fostering innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets. These Alliances among HE, VET and the enterprises are expected to contribute to the development of regional eco-systems and directly provide a valuable input to the economy, integrating workbased learning. While universities have research knowledge and data that allows them to directly provide input to small and medium sized enterprises to boost local economies, VET providers supply skills needed by enterprises and they are able to foster growth in the local economy.</p><p>At a larger scale, Alliances for Innovation are expected to target societal and economic challenges, both in education and employment, and take into account key areas such as innovation challenges, skills provision, climate change, green economy, demography, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Benefits can also be drawn from cooperation with large enterprises. The Alliances for Innovation will focus on the need of citizens and accelerate the modernization of HE and VET.</p><p>The Pact for Skills will not only establish a framework for the implementation of the other actions of the updated Skills Agenda, but also for the dissemination and exploitation of the project results of the Alliances for Innovation. In particular the results of the Blueprint Alliances for sectoral cooperation on skills will be used as a basis for the Pact for Skills sectoral large-scale partnerships.</p><p>In addition, the Alliances will help to implement the EU Communication on the Renewed Agenda for Higher Education (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017DC0247) and contribute to the creation of a European Education Area (https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area_en). They will also contribute to implement the EU Industrial and SMEs strategies (2021).</p><p>The Alliances for Innovation will also take into account the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and the Paris Declaration on Climate Change (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) as overarching parameters of the action, thus helping the European Commission to implement its new Green Deal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/european-green-deal-communication_en.pdf) and the Europe Recovery Plan (https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en). The Alliances will also contribute ideas to the New European Bauhaus initiative (https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en) which aims to design new sustainable ways of living to meet the objectives of the Green Deal.</p><p>Alliances for Innovation are meant to have a short and long term impact on the wider range of stakeholders involved, at individual, organisational and systemic level. This impact is expected to go beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations involved in the partnerships. It is expected that partnership and activities persist. For that, results/deliverables might not be stand-alone but be linked to/integrated into existing undertakings, schemes, projects, platforms, ventures etc.</p><p><strong>AWARD CRITERIA</strong></p><p><strong>Relevance of the project</strong></p><p>(maximum score 25 points)</p><ul level="0"><li><strong>Link to EU policy and initiatives:</strong> the proposal takes into account and contributes to achieving the European objectives in the fields of VET and higher education; the proposal takes into account and contributes to giving visibility to existing EU tools and initiatives for skills development;</li><li><strong>Purpose:</strong> the proposal is relevant to the objectives and activities of the Action;</li><li><strong>Consistency:</strong> the objectives are based on a sound needs analysis; they are clearly defined, realistic and address issues relevant to the participating organisations and to the Action;</li><li><strong>Innovation:</strong> the proposal considers state-of-the-art methods and techniques, and leads to project-specific innovative results and solutions;</li><li><strong>European added value: </strong>the proposal demonstrates clearly the added value generated through its trans-nationality and potential transferability;</li><li><strong>Education &amp; training representation:</strong> the Alliance includes partners that adequately represent education &amp; training providers;</li><li><strong>Digital skills:</strong> extent to which the proposal integrates digital skills in the training content for one, or several related occupational profiles;</li><li><strong>Green skills:</strong> the proposal integrates skills linked to the transition to a circular and greener economy in the training content for one, or several related occupational profiles;</li><li><strong>Resilience skills:</strong> extent to which the proposal integrates skills linked to the capacity to adapt, manage change, and care for each other as a community.</li> </ul><p><strong>Quality of the project design and implementation</strong></p><p>(maximum score 30 points)</p><ul level="0"><li><strong>Coherence:</strong> the overall project design ensures consistency between project objectives, methodology, activities and budget proposed.
