<span class="topicdescriptionkind">Scope</span>:<p>New production and distribution trends (e.g. globalisation, lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventory) as well as emerging digital technologies have introduced new kinds of challenges to the supply chain. Together with resilient and smart infrastructures, new concepts, innovative solutions and better cooperation of operators are needed for freight transport to minimise the negative impacts of disruptions, shorten the recovery and ease the transition time, while taking in due account emissions and energy consumption reductions as feasible.</p><p>Research and innovation actions will have to bring together stakeholders at various level, from supply chain (e.g. manufacturers, retailers, freight forwarders and logistics service providers), transport services (e.g. transport operators, enforcing authorities) and infrastructure networks (e.g. road / rail / inland waterways operators and transport node public authorities) to ensure a truly integrated and jointly acceptable approach.</p><p>Proposals will have to:</p><ul level="0"><li>Evaluate the resilience of strategic logistics networks and their related data and IT systems and propose management systems and operations, including alternative networks and transport services, to increase their resilience against natural, accidental and human triggered disruptive events. Proposed concepts and solutions should be suitable to increase the resilience and sustainability of the entire transport network. Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 crisis on how to make supply chains concurrently more resilient to large-scale shocks and environmentally friendly should be considered.</li><li>Develop and demonstrate how synchro-modal approaches (shipment split and merge, dynamic synchronisation of multimodal schedules, realignment in case of disruptions etc.) provide resilience and sustainability by design to the freight transport and logistics networks in which these services are operated.</li><li>Develop business intelligence capabilities, such as intermodal freight corridor performance and resilient measurement and assessment (e.g. evaluate what could be the alternative logistics networks and services to manage a failure in a main infrastructure in a transport corridor).</li><li>Define cost-efficient and green new business models able to be adopted by the sector in the short-medium term and propose business/regulatory roadmaps and recommendations to support the adoption of the new proposed approaches and other solutions enhancing the capability to manage disruptions.</li> </ul><p>Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.</p><p>Establishing synergies with projects funded under the Cluster 3 Civil Security for Society topic ‘Ensured infrastructure resilience in case of Pandemics’ could be envisaged.</p>

<h2 id="destination">Destination: Safe, Resilient Transport and Smart Mobility services for passengers and goods</h2><p>This Destination includes activities addressing safe and smart mobility services for passengers and goods.</p><p>Europe needs to manage the transformation of supply-based transport into safe, resilient and sustainable transport and demand-driven, smart mobility services for passengers and goods. Suitable research and innovation will enable significant safety, environmental, economic and social benefits by reducing accidents caused by human error, decreasing traffic congestion, reducing energy consumption and emissions of vehicles, increasing efficiency and productivity of freight transport operations. To succeed in this transformation, Europe’s ageing (and not always sustainable) transport infrastructure needs to be prepared for enabling cleaner and smarter operations.</p><p>Europe needs also to maintain a high-level of transport safety for its citizens. Resilience should be built in the transport systems to prevent, mitigate and recover from disruptions. Research and innovation will underpin the three safety pillars: technologies, regulations and human factors.</p><p>This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan’s <strong>Key Strategic Orientations (KSO)</strong>:</p><ul level="0"><li><em>C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy</em><em> through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;</em></li><li><em>A:</em><em> Promoting an open strategic autonomy</em>[[<em>‘Open strategic autonomy’ refers to the term ‘strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy’, as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 – 2 October 2020.</em>]]<em> by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains </em><em>to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations.</em></li> </ul><p>It covers the following <strong>impact areas</strong>:</p><ul level="0"><li>Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;</li><li>Smart and sustainable transport.</li> </ul><p>The <strong>expected impact</strong>, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to <em>“Safe, seamless, smart, inclusive, resilient and sustainable mobility systems for people and goods thanks to user-centric technologies and services including digital technologies and advanced satellite navigation services”</em>, notably through:</p><ol level="0" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> <li>Accelerating the implementation of innovative <strong>connected, cooperative and automated mobility (CCAM) </strong>technologies and systems for passengers and goods (more detailed information below).</li><li>Further developing a <strong>multimodal transport system</strong> through sustainable and smart long-haul and urban freight transport and <strong>logistics</strong>, upgraded and resilient physical and digital <strong>infrastructures</strong> for smarter vehicles and operations, for optimised system-wide network efficiency (more detailed information below).</li><li>Drastically decreasing the number of <strong>transport accidents, incidents and fatalities</strong> towards the EU’s long-term goal of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries by 2050 even in road transportation (Vision Zero) and increase the <strong>resilience</strong> of transport systems (more detailed information below).</li> </ol><p><strong><em><u>Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM)</u></em></strong></p><p>The aim of relevant topics under this Destination is to accelerate the implementation of innovative connected, cooperative and automated mobility (CCAM) technologies and systems. Actions will help to develop new mobility concepts for passengers and goods – enabled by CCAM - leading to healthier, safer, more accessible, sustainable, cost-effective and demand-responsive transport everywhere. CCAM solutions will shift design and development from a driver-centred to mobility-user oriented approach, providing viable alternatives for private vehicle ownership while increasing inclusiveness of mobility. CCAM must be integrated in the whole transport system to fully exploit the potential benefits of CCAM and minimise potential adverse effects, such as increasingly congested traffic or new risks in mixed traffic environments.</p><p>The focus is on road transport, but relevant interfaces with other modes (for instance transfers and integration with public transport or rail freight transport) will be considered.</p><p>All technologies, solutions, testing and demonstration activities resulting from these actions should be documented fully and transparently, to ensure replicability, increase adoption, up-scaling, assist future planning decisions and EU and national policy-making and increase citizen buy-in.</p><p>Actions are in line with the recommendations of the new European Partnership on CCAM. The Vision of the Partnership is: “European leadership in safe and sustainable road transport through automation”. It aims to harmonise European R&amp;I efforts to accelerate the implementation of innovative CCAM technologies and services. It aims to exploit the full systemic benefits of new mobility solutions enabled by CCAM. The European Partnership on CCAM plans to closely cooperate with other European Partnerships, in particular with “Towards zero emission road transport” (2ZERO), “Driving Urban Transitions” (DUT), “Key digital technologies” (KDT), “Smart networks and services” (SNS) and “AI, data and robotics” (AI). The European Partnership will establish cooperation mechanisms to ensure close interaction when defining R&amp;I actions to maximise synergies and avoid overlaps.</p><p>R&amp;I actions taking place at a socio-technical level aiming to better understand the science-society relationship (particularly when social practices, market uptake or ownership are concerned) should favour solutions that are grounded in social innovation in order to achieve its desired outcomes, i.e. by matching innovative ideas with social needs and by forming new collaborations between public and private actors, including civil society and researchers from the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH).</p><p>To test CCAM solutions, applicants can seek possibilities of involving the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in order to valorise the relevant expertise and physical facilities of JRC in demonstrating and testing energy and mobility applications of the JRC Living Lab for Future Urban Ecosystems <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc">https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc</a></p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting connected, cooperative and automated mobility under this Destination are:</p><ul level="0"><li>Validated safety and security, improved robustness and resilience of CCAM technologies and systems.</li><li>Secure and trustworthy interaction between road users, CCAM and “conventional” vehicles, infrastructure and services to achieve safer and more efficient transport flows (people and goods) and better use of infrastructure capacity.</li><li>Seamless, affordable and user oriented CCAM based mobility and goods deliveries for all and high public acceptance of these services with clear understanding of its benefits and limits as well as rebound effects; based on the changing mobility needs and desires of a society in transition (digitally and environmentally).</li><li>Better coordination of R&amp;I and large-scale testing activities in Europe and expanded knowledge base on CCAM solutions.</li><li>European leadership in the development and deployment of connected and automated mobility and logistics services and systems, ensuring long-term growth and jobs.</li> </ul><p><strong><em><u>Multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and goods</u></em></strong></p><p>Multimodal and sustainable transport systems are the backbone for efficient mobility of passengers and freight. In particular, the areas of infrastructure, logistics and network/traffic management play a major role in making mobility and transport climate neutral, also through the digitalisation of the sectors. At the same time, being vulnerable to climate change and other disruptions, resilience in these three areas need to be increased. New and advanced infrastructures across all transport modes are required to enable the introduction of new vehicles, operations and mobility services. Furthermore, efficient and smart multimodal logistics are key for seamless and sustainable long-haul, regional and urban freight transport movements. Finally, dynamic multimodal network and traffic management systems are the “glue” of the entire transport network, for optimised door-to-door mobility of both passengers and freight.</p><p>To test solutions related to multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and good, applicants may seek possibilities of involving the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in order to valorise the relevant expertise and physical facilities of JRC in demonstrating and testing energy and mobility applications of the JRC Living Lab for Future Urban Ecosystems[[<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc">https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc</a>]].</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting Multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and goods under this Destination are:</p><ul level="0"><li>Upgraded and resilient physical and digital infrastructure for clean, accessible, affordable, connected and automated multimodal mobility.</li><li>Sustainable and smart long-haul, regional and urban freight transport and logistics, through increased efficiency, improved interconnectivity and smart enforcement.</li><li>Reduced external costs (e.g. congestion, traffic jams, emissions, air and noise pollution, road collisions) of urban, peri-urban (regional) and long distance freight transport as well as optimised system-wide network efficiency and resilience.</li><li>Enhanced local and/or regional capacity for governance and innovation in urban mobility and logistics.</li> </ul><p><strong><em><u>Safety and resilience - per mode and across all transport modes</u></em></strong></p><p>Safety and resilience are of primary concern for any transport system. The EU set ambitious targets in its 2011 Transport White Paper, the third Mobility Package and, more recently, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[[COM(2020) 789 final.]]. COVID-19 has been a stark reminder of the importance of resilience to external disruptions, particularly for transport. Research and innovation will underpin the three pillars affecting safety and resilience: technologies; regulations (alongside acceptable level of risks); and human factors (individual and organisational aspects, including interaction with automation). The approach is risk-based and systemic, including transport means/vehicles, infrastructure, the physical environment (e.g. weather) and the various actors (e.g. manufacturers, regulators, operators, users) as well as all their interfaces, including certification and standardisation bodies.</p><p>Synergies should be exploited across research at national, EU and international level together with national authorities, EU agencies and international organisations to improve rulemaking, safety promotion and oversight.</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting transport safety and resilience under this Destination are:</p><p><em>Safety in Urban Areas/ Road Transport Safety</em></p><ul level="0"><li>50% reduction in serious injuries and fatalities in road crashes by 2030.</li><li>Improved reliability and performance of systems that aim to anticipate and minimize safety risks, avoiding risks and collisions, and reducing the consequences of unavoidable crashes.</li><li>Drastic reduction of road fatalities and serious crash injuries in low and medium income countries in Africa.</li><li>Better design principles of future road transport systems enabling also better traffic flow in big cities.</li> </ul><p><em>Waterborne Safety and Resilience</em></p><ul level="0"><li>Ensure healthy passenger shipping by preventing and mitigating the spread of contagious diseases and infections.</li> </ul><p><em>Aviation Safety and Resilience</em></p><ul level="0"><li>Decrease number of accidents and incidents due to organisational/human/automation factors and external hazards in all phases of flight, also beyond CAT category (80% goal in FlightPath2050), while enabling all weather operations.</li><li>Saving lives following a crash (post-crash survivability).</li><li>Anticipate emergence of new threats that could generate potential accidents and incidents (short, medium, and long term).</li><li>Ensure safety through aviation transformation (from green/digital technologies uptake up to independent certification).</li><li>Maintain safety and resilience despite the scale, pace and diversity of new entrants.</li> </ul><h2 id="conditions">Topic Conditions and Documents</h2><p><b><span lang="EN-US" style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;
