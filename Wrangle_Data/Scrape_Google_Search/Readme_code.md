[Backlog](https://github.com/lustraka/data-analyst-portfolio-project-2022/blob/main/code/ReadBacklog.md)

## November 2021
2021-11-19 Fri : (1) **Business Knowledge Blueprints**. This book written by Ronald G. Ross and published in 2020 provides guidelines for creating a concept model for a universe of discourse. To clarify our communication we need to clarify concepts, their relations and their expression that should be readable, understandable, precise, and reliable. (2) **Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program** provides an opportunity to practise data analytics as well as links to useful resources. 

(3) **Logical Framework Approach & Matrix** is an analytical process and set of tools used to support project planning and management. It provides a set of interlocking concepts which are used as a part of an interactive process to aid structured and systematic analysis of a project idea. The Logical Framework Approach (LFA) is an analytical process (involving stakeholder analysis, problem analysis, objective setting, and strategy selection). The Logical Framework Matrix (LFM or Logframe) is the documented product of the analytical process.

(4) **Stakeholder Analysis**. There is plenty of resources on how to build a data analytics portfolio for a data analyst to choose from. Any of them can trigger the flow of analytical thoughts and steps. Are there some stakeholders interested in some organization and systemization of this domain? What could be the value delivered by such clarification and standardization?

(5) **Topic Map**. The duty - KSBs mapping in the Institute of Apprenticeships is a good example of a concept map. Similar kind of mapping can be quite useful when an analyst needs to find the source with a code pattern they wants to use. Try service (duty) - KSBs - resources (urls) model with a CSV interface and an SQL database. [16 fsp]

2021-11-12 Fri : **By Hand**. Discovering knowledge in unstructured data is tedious. An analyst manages to go through first 20 web pages and identify some of their properties. See [WP_root_collect_data_by_hand.md](https://github.com/lustraka/data-analyst-portfolio-project-2022/blob/main/data/WP_root_collect_data_by_hand.md). [8 fsp]

2021-11-11 Thu: **Refactoring**. An analyst trains a new "model" that scrapes results of a google search and store it in a database. A log of scraping in markdown friendly. [6 fsp]

2021-11-10 Wed: (1) An analyst creates a **repository** and plans next steps. Besides the inital list of web pages scraped from a google search there is a wide set of references that provides guidelines for the work. The key habit is rooted in Zen-to-Done approach (Collect > Process > Organize > Systemize > Plan > Simplify > Do > Review > Build a Routine > Find Your Passion). (2) **SQLite Database**. An analyst scrapes the content of initial webpages and stores is into the `dapp2022.db` database. Then he verify the possibility to retrive the content and search the text. [6 fsp]
