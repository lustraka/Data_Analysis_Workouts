        "## Data Quality Dimensions (Aspects, Measures, Categories)\n",
        "Data quality dimensions help guide your thought process while assessing and also cleaning. The four main data quality dimensions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Completeness**: do we have all of the records that we should? Do we have missing records or not? Are there specific rows, columns, or cells missing?\n",
        "2. **Validity**: we have the records, but they're not valid, i.e., they don't conform to a defined schema. A schema is a defined set of rules for data. These rules can be real-world constraints (e.g. negative height is impossible) and table-specific constraints (e.g. unique key constraints in tables).\n",
        "3. **Accuracy**: inaccurate data is wrong data that is valid. It adheres to the defined schema, but it is still incorrect. Example: a patient's weight that is 5 lbs too heavy because the scale was faulty.\n",
        "4. **Consistency**: inconsistent data is both valid and accurate, but there are multiple correct ways of referring to the same thing. Consistency, i.e., a standard format, in columns that represent the same data across tables and/or within tables is desired.\n",
        "These are listed in decreasing order of severity, meaning that the dimension listed first, completeness, is the most important.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regarding the other data quality research mentioned in the video, the additional dimensions are specific cases of these four dimensions listed above. Example: *currency*, defined as follows: *the degree to which data is current with the world that it models. Currency can measure how up-to-date data is.* Currency is a specific case of accuracy in data in the sense that out-of-date data is (usually) valid but wrong. In other words, our definition of accuracy can include currency.\n",
