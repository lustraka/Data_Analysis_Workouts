# Investigate Gapminder's World Development Indicators

# Introduction

**[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/)** has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators. The complete datasets with hundreds of indicators are available in GitHub repositories, one of which is World Development Indicators (WDI). The data is organized in loose CSV files that can be consumed by any spreadsheet software. More efficient way of consuming data is by using [DDF data model](https://open-numbers.github.io/ddf.html).
