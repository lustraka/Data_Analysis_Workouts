# Investigate Gapminder's World Development Indicators

# Gapminder Data Set
Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in diferent countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of dierent indicators. For this project, you should select at least three indicators to investigate.
- Data is provided as Excel spreadsheet files. You will want to use a spreadsheet program to export each table as a csv file.
- You will want to look into ways of reshaping your data so that it is tidy, especially if you want to do comparisons across indicators. After joining your data together, your columns might look like: {Country, Year, Indicator 1 Value, Indicator 2 Value, â€¦ }...
- Some of the datasets might have been updated since they were collected on Gapminder. If you use these updated datasets, make sure you document this in your report.

**Example Question**: Have certain regions of the world been growing in your selected metrics better than others? Are there trends that can be observed between the selected metrics?
