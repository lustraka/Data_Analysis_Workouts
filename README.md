# Data Analysis Workouts

The repository contains projects inspired by Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

I took this online course to master a data analysis process that involve five steps: (1) Ask question; (2) Wrangle data; (3) Explore data; (4) Draw conclusions; (5) Communicate results; and uses Python, SQL, and statistic to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions.

The program focuses on learning by doing. To graduate, I completed a series of projects submitted for review by Udacity's mentors. Here is an overview of these projects.

- Explore Weather Trends
- Investigate Gapminder's World Development Indicators
- Analyze A/B Test Results
- Wrangle and Analyze Data
- Communicate Data Findings
