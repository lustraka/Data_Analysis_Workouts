# Data Analysis Workouts

The repository contains projects from Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

I took this online course to master a data analysis process that involve five steps: (1) Ask question; (2) Wrangle data; (3) Explore data; (4) Draw conclusions; (5) Communicate results; and uses Python, SQL, and statistic to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions.

The program focuses on learning by doing. To graduate, I completed a series of projects submitted for review by Udacity's mentors. Here is an overview of these projects.

# Explore Weather Trends

# Investigate Gapminder's World Development Indicators

# Analyze A/B Test Results

# Wrangle and Analyze Data

# Communicate Data Findings
