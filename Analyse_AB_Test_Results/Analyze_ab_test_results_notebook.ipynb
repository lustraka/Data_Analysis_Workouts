    "\n",

    "- $Z_{score}$\n",
    "- $Z_{\\alpha}$ or $Z_{0.05}$, also known as critical value at 95% confidence interval.  $Z_{0.05}$ is 1.645 for one-tailed tests,  and 1.960 for two-tailed test. You can determine the $Z_{\\alpha}$ from the z-table manually. \n",

    "Decide if your hypothesis is either a two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed test. Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\\alpha}$. We determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the \"rejection region\" in the distribution. In other words, a \"rejection region\" is an interval where the null hypothesis is rejected iff the $Z_{score}$ lies in that region.\n",
